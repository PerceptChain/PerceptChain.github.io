# PerceptChain Website

### Using the CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
